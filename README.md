# AFI SWiM

For the downloadable version of this project, head over to [afi-swim](https://github.com/willswire/afi-swim).

A few weeks ago I posted a downloadable tool for this, but I figured it would be an uphill battle to get it AF Net approved.
The web version does the same thing: extract Shall, Will, and Must keywords from AFIs for better readability and reference. The resulting Excel workbook also includes a column for waiver authority (tier level).
